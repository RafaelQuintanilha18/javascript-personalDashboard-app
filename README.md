<h2>The Personal Dashboard App</h2>
<h3>What is it?</h3>
<p>My Javascript practice project and coppycat of the <a href="https://momentumdash.com/">MomentumDash</a>. The Personal Dashboard it's a page or a chrome extension (you just need to download this repo and load it on your Chrome extension to replace your default new page). The app is fetching different APIs to display the weather conditions based on your location (don't forget to allow your location), the current time, many awesome nature photographs, and the Bitcoin price: the present, and the 24h maximum and minimum. My goal is to keep working on this app and add new features with different APIs later on.</p>
